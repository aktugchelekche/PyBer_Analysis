# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project:

As an data analyst, I will perform exploratory analysis on a data that contains information regarding number of drivers, cost of ride in different type of cities. I will create several charts and visualizations to tell a compelling story about it. For this analysis, I will utilize Panda's libraries, Jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib to create charts and demonstrate the relation between type of cities, number of drivers as well as riders. 

#### Purpose of PyBer Analysis :

The analysis and visualization that I will provide with will help Pyber to improve access to ride-sharing service(s) and determine affordability for undeserved neighborhoods .

## Analysis

In first part of my analysis, I merged and created a new dataset from 2 distinct datasets that was provided by the company. By using the dataset,I created a summary dataframe. 

I manipulated this dataframe by creating a pivot of it then demonstrate the relation and correlation regarding the cost of rides in different type of cities during Jan and April 2019 .

##### By Analyzing at the summary dataframe we can conclude following results: 

1. Highest Earning per Ride : Rural Drivers.

   Lowest Earning per Ride  : Urban Drivers. 

2. Cost of per Ride Highest : Rural cities. 

   Cost of per Ride Lowest  : Urban cities.

3. There is a negative correlation between average cost of per ride, average    earning per driver and size of the city type. 

4. The number of drivers and rides in Urban cities are around 30 times more than rural cities and around 5 times more than suburban cities. 

##### By Analyzing Multi Line Chart we can conclude following results:

1. By end of February, average cost ride in Urban and Suburban cities reach its maximum and beginning of April average cost ride in Rural reach its maximum during Jan-April window. 
2. Total Fare from January to April :

    * Urban Cities    : $2,000 to $2,500 (Average : $2,098)
    * Suburban Cities : $900 to 1,200 (Average : $1,020)
    * Rural Cities    : $170 to $290 (Average : $ 225 ) 

# Summary 

### My recommendations to CEO based on the analysis : 

1. My first recommendation would be on Urban cities. It is obvious that the company has most revenue from these cities as number of rides and drives are the highest. 
However, profit for each driver per each ride is much less than the other type of cities. Number of rides are 67% less than number of drivers. To refrain losing drivers(decrease company revenue), the company might seek for expanding its operation and add different type of services such as food delivery and virtual business delivery to meet with expectation of the drivers. Also, a pointing system for drivers performance would help increase service quality and decrease number of driver. 
2. In both Rural and Suburban cities, number of rides are fairly more than number of drivers. Looking for new drivers to join the company while making sure it doesn't exceed the number of rides, would add more profit in mentioned cities. 
3. Lastly in Rural cities, first action from company is to add more drivers to the operation and lower the cost for per ride since they are the undeserved cities. Also, they need to ensure that people are aware of this service. Connecting with local community leaders, schools and local media services will help increase company awareness among people who would like to be part of it or customer for it.
