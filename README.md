# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project:

As an data analyst, I will perform exploratory analysis on a data that contains information regarding different type of cities in where cost of private transportation. I will create several charts and visualizations to tell a compelling story about it. For this analysis, I will utilize Panda's libraries, Jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib to create charts and demonstrate the relation between type of cities, number of drivers as well as riders. 

#### Purpose of PyBer Analysis :

The analysis and visualization that I will provide with will help Pyber to improve access to ride-sharing service(s) and determine affordability for undeserved neighborhoods .
